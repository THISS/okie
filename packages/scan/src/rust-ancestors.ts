/**
 * CLA-305: rust-analyzer and cargo read configuration from the ANCESTORS of the tree they analyse, not only the tree.
 * Verified with rust-analyzer 1.87 / cargo 1.87 (docs/architecture/scan-sandbox.md):
 * - a rust-project.json / .rust-project.json (any letter case on a case-insensitive FS) in ANY ancestor is loaded
 *   instead of the tree's own Cargo.toml: its `sysroot` binaries run and the tree is not indexed;
 * - an ancestor `.cargo/config.toml` applies (its rustc / wrapper keys are neutralised by the scan-env pins, but other
 *   keys still shape `cargo metadata`, so it could poison the content-keyed SCIP cache);
 * - an ancestor Cargo.toml `[workspace]` captures a single-package tree (cargo metadata then fails outright).
 *
 * So before Rust analysis every ancestor of the analysis root must be owned by root or the scanner's uid and not
 * group/other-writable (no sticky-bit exemption: /tmp fails), no ancestor may hold a rust-project.json, and the
 * operator's own ancestor cargo config / manifests are recorded as limitations and folded into the cache key.
