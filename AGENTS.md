Repo conventions, commands, and gotchas live in [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md). Follow those. The section below is extra for Cursor Cloud agents.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

Before opening or closing a pull request, QA must **explore the running application** — not only unit tests, logs, or `GET /healthz`. A diff-only pass or a single screenshot is not enough.

1. Boot the app the way a user would:
   - Scan server: `node apps/server/dist/main.js` on `http://127.0.0.1:4180` (Vite proxies `/api` and `/scan` here). Bind is loopback; this process has no auth.
   - Web: `pnpm dev` on `http://localhost:4173` (regenerates WASM + the stress fixture first). If those generated outputs already exist, `pnpm --filter @okie/web dev` is enough to serve the UI.
2. Exercise the changed flow in the browser the way a real user would: click, type, submit, navigate. Confirm behavior, not just appearance.
3. For atlas work, play the guided story (jump to a step and wait for `[data-playback-state="paused"]`, not a fixed delay), select a node, and confirm the inspector is not blank. Check related routes that share state (`/`, `/new`, `?fixture=scan` when a scan fixture is present).
4. Do not open or close a PR until that app exploration is done. Automated tests (`pnpm check`, `pnpm test`, `cargo test --workspace` as in `CLAUDE.md`) remain required; they do not replace it.

Dev diagnostics (renderer/backend pill, View/Edit, `+ Diagram`) are hidden until `Shift+Alt+D`. Never log API keys or put them on `/healthz`. Do not run live OpenRouter in CI; fake/fixture servers only unless the slice explicitly requires a live scan.
